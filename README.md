# IV_Horiseon
# Description
What? As a developer, I have been tasked to revamp a "functioning" website for a client, Horiseon, a marketing agency. The goal of the revamp is to make the website follow accessibilty standards and to be optimized for search engines. In order to meet that goal I will be refactoring the code to include HTML semantic elements and accessibilty standards.

Why? The reason it is important to follow semantic elements structure is becasue the code becomes easier to read. The code becomes easier to read for people with disabilities who use a screen readers or other assistive technologies. Additionally, SEO engines can read the content that is used within the HTML semantic elements so the website becomes better positioned in search engines. On the other hand, using simple div tags does not help with SEO. The goal here is to remove all the div tags and replace them with HTML semantic elements, as well as adding alt text to all images.

How?

First, I started by thinking of the structure or the shell of how my project needs to be shaped. To guide me I used the following structure:

Once I had my structure in mind, semantic HTML, I took a look at the code provided. I quickly noticed that there were way too many div tags and not very many semantic elements. I started to break up the code into parts to match my structure guide. Then when I had my struture broken up into I parts I replaced all of the div tags that were not necessary and I replaced them with the common elements used in the HTML semantic structure: header, nav, section, article, and footer. Then I went into the css sheet and made the corresponding changes there too. The edits in css consisted of chagning the types from classes to elements. I also found that since there were many unnecesary classes that were repetative, I was able to consolidate them in the css to match their corresponding element. Once I confirmed the code was working correctly, I went in to the code and made comments for the changes that I made. Then I went in the code and added alt text to the images by " alt "text" " within the image tag. FInally I edited the title tag to a descriptive website name so that the website title tab can be updated. To impress the clients I also went in and fixed some links that were not working by fixing a typo corresponding to the first button on the navigation tab as well as revising the website title. Finally, I added comments to all of the changes that I madde. 

# Credits 
For this project I used resources such as examples from class activities and also help from tutoring. During my time researching and reviewing I used a few of the following sources:https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/How-to-push-an-existing-project-to-GitHub - this video and article helped me with learning how to push the existing started code to GitHub. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPUpk28cngg - this video was good to stress that div tags do not help the semantic structure of your project https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_accessibility.asp https://blog.hubspot.com/website/html-accessibility#:~:text=Well%2Dstructured%20semantic%20HTML%20helps,%3E%20and%20tags. https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
